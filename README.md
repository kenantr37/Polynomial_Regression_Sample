# Polynomial Regression Sample
In this repository I made a very basic Polynomial Regression Sample to understand better what are differences between
Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression and for doing this I created very basic csv file which has 2 columns</br>
Fist column is car's price and second one is car's speed.I would like to forecast car's speed which is influenced by car's price.</br>

As you can see below, when we want to forecast car's speed by using linear regression, it gives us unstable and</br>
pointless prediction.This is because car's speed always increases with this model.But how can it be real? Does this car turn into a plane?

Below, you can see what polynomial regression model gave to us stable(not %100) forecast like what we anticipated.</br>
Doubtless, this model could be better and better but I've been learning and working on it.

In this part, I wanted to exhibit what is difference between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression
